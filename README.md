# TrafficForum
An android project based on google map api and firebase.<br/>
We create a traffic event reporting system and show events on googlmMap with marker. The likes and comments(not finnished) 
function are also implemented on event level.<br/>
We utilize firebase to provide a real-time response and keep like number accurate in concurrences. Moreover, FCM is used to 
send alerts when any user send a event.<br/>
